    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p class='lead'>Artsdata.ca aims to empower the Canadian arts sector to leverage linked open data and actively promote a more
      fair and equitable digital ecosystem. This initiative is building a machine-readable knowledge graph of the arts
      that is open and accessible to all.</p>

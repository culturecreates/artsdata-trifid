    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Artsdata.ca aims to empower the Canadian arts sector to leverage linked open data and actively promote a more
      fair and equitable digital ecosystem. This initiative is building a machine-readable knowledge graph of the arts
      that is open and accessible to all.</p>

    <h2>About Artsdata.ca</h2>

      focused on the Canadian arts sector. The objectives are to:
      <ul>
        <li>Build a substantial web of linked open data of arts-related information</li>
        <li>Provide high-quality data that is comprehensive and up to date</li>
        <li>Create a valuable resource for the arts sector</li>
        <li>Make a digital resource that reflects the values of the arts</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

          arts sector </li>

          open data with the goal of creating a substantial web of data</li>
